# The 20 Games Challenge

This is a repository to showcase my personal journey focused on improving my skills as a game developer, using the list from [20 Games Challenge](https://20_games_challenge.gitlab.io/).

## About

To give this challenge a personal identity, I don't intend to faithfully follow the visual style of each game.  
This challenge is not just about finishing games, but about:

- Developing discipline and consistency
- Creating a personal style
- Learning by doing
- Documenting progress over time

At the end of the challenge, this repository will represent both my technical growth and my creative identity as a game developer.

### Tools & Game Engine

I will focus on free and open-source tools.  
As a game engine: [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org)
